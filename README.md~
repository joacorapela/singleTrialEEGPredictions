# Input data

The input data should be epoched activations of Independent Components (ICs)
from an Independent Component Analysis. Epochs should be built around the
presentation of standards of a given modality (e.g., standardModality \in
{Auditory or Visual}) under a given attentional state (e.g., attentionCondition
\in {switchvision, switchaudition}).  Components should be grouped in clusters
(e.g., clusterID \in 1:19).

In the directory data we provide an example dataset from clusterID 4, Visual
standardModality and switchvision attended modality.

For each <clusterID>, <attentionCondition>, and <standardModality> one
should provide six files, named as follows:

    1. inputClusterID<clusterID>Condition<attentionCondition>Sortvars<sortvar><<standardModality>Stim_metaData.dat

    This should be a file in double format with 3 values: 

        1. nSamplesPerTrial (i.e., number of samples per epoch), 

        2. nTrialsAllSubjects (i.e., the sum of the number of trials of all
subjects for <attentionCondition> and <standardModality>), 

        3. sampleRate

    2. inputClusterID<clusterID>Condition<attentionCondition>Sortvars<sortvar><<standardModality>Stim_data.dat

    This should be a file in double format with nSamplesPerTrial x
nTrialsAllSubjects values. This file should contain the activations of all ICs
from all subjects for <attentionCondition> and <standardModality>).

    3.  inputClusterID<clusterID>Condition<attentionCondition>Sortvars<sortvar><<standardModality>Stim_epochEventIDs.dat

    This should be a file in double format with nTrialsAllSubjects values. This
file should contain the identification numbers of all trials (i.e., epochs)
from all independent components (ICs) from all subjects for
<attentionCondition> and <standardModality>).

    4.  inputClusterID<clusterID>Condition<attentionCondition>Sortvars<sortvar><<standardModality>Stim_times.dat

    This should be a file in double format with nSamplesPerTrial values. This
file should contain the times corresponding to the samples of every trial from
all independent components (ICs) from all subjects for <attentionCondition> and
<standardModality>).

    5.  inputClusterID<clusterID>Condition<attentionCondition>Sortvars<sortvar><<standardModality>Stim_components.dat

    This should be a file in double format with nTrialsAllSubjects values. This
file should contain the IC number corresponding to each trial (i.e., epoch)
from all subjects for <attentionCondition> and <standardModality>).

    6.  inputClusterID<clusterID>Condition<attentionCondition>Sortvars<sortvar><<standardModality>Stim_subjectNames.dat

    This should be a file in plain text format with nTrialsAllSubjects lines.
The ith line should contain the subject name correspoding to the ith trial
(i.e., epoch).

The previous six files appear under data/erpImages.

In addition one should provide the following files:

    1.  sfpds<subjectName><standardModality><attentionCondition>.dat

    This should be a file in double format. The first value of this file should
contain the length of the file and the remainder values should be the
vectorized form of a matrix with number of rows equal to the number of trials
for <subjectName>, <sandardModality> and <attentionCondition>. This matrix
should contain two columns; the first one should contain identification numbers
of trials and the second one the corresponding standard foreperiod durations.

These files appear under data/sfpds.

    2. subjectsAndComponentsClusterID<clusterID>.tsv

    This should be a tab separated text file with as many rows as components in
<clusterID>. It should contain two columns; the first one should give the
name of a subject and the second one a component number of this subject that
has been grouped in <clusterID>.

These files appear under data/subjectsAndComponents.

    3. errorRates<condition>.tsv
 
    This should be a tab separated text file with as many rows as subjects in
the experiment. It should contain four columns; the first one should give the
name of a subject, and the second, third, and fourth columns should give the
mean error rate, and the lower and higher bounds of the 95% confidence interval
of the mean error rate, respectively.

These files appear under data/behavioralAnalysis/errorRates.

# Data analysis

Before performing any analysis one should run the script doSaveSFPDsInfo.R in
the root folder. This script groups all SFPDs into a single R file and saves
this file as results/sfpds/
